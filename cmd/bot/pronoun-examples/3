"Oh, I've had such a curious dream!" said **{{.Subjective}}**, and **{{.Subjective}}** told **{{.PossDet}}** sister, as well as **{{.Subjective}}** could remember them, all these strange Adventures of **{{.PossPro}}** that you have just been reading about; and when **{{.Subjective}}** had finished, **{{.PossDet}}** sister kissed **{{.Objective}}**, and said, "It WAS a curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's getting late." So **{{.Subjective}}** got up and ran off, thinking while **{{.Subjective}}** ran, as well **{{.Subjective}}** might, what a wonderful dream it had been.
