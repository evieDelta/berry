By continuing to use %v's commands, you consent to us processing the data listed below in a manner compliant with the GDPR.

This is the data %v collects:

- A list of blacklisted channels per server

This is the data %v collects, and which is deleted after 30 days:

- Information about internal errors: command, user ID, and channel ID

This is the data %v stores in memory for as long as it's needed (up to 15 minutes), and which is always wiped on a bot restart:

- Message metadata *for its own messages*
- Message metadata for messages that trigger commands

This is the data %v does *not* collect:

- Any message contents
- Any user information
- Information about messages that do not trigger commands

Additionally, there are daily database backups, which only include a list of blacklisted channels (as well as all terms/explanations).

To delete server information from the database, simply have the bot leave the server, through kicking or banning it. Do note that this does *not* delete server information from database backups, only the live database (and any later backups). Contact us (on the support server, or [here](%vcontact)) if you want that deleted too, or have any other requests regarding your data. We'll comply with these within 30 days.
